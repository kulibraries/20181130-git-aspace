  This hands-on workshop draws on Git and GitHub lessons from <a href="{{site.lc_site}}">Library Carpentry</a> and the <a href="https://science.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Science Lab</a> to introduce version control and collaboration using these common tools. Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own work problems.<br/>
  For more information on the Library Carpentry curriculum, please see "<a href="http://doi.org/10.18352/lq.10176">Library Carpentry: software skills training for library professionals</a>".
